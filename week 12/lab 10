Exercise 1:

Read committed:

1- Both terminals show the same results because the isolation level doesn't allow dirty reads 


2- while doing Update the balance for Alice’s account, the value increased just by 20 as there is a loss in the update.
The isolation level doesn't protect from lost updates.

Repeatable Read:

1- Both terminals show the same results because the isolation level doesn't allow dirty reads 


2- while doing Update the balance for Alice’s account, the value increased by 30 
   because the isolation level protects from lost updates.
   
   
Exercise 2:

Read committed: 

It seems that this isolation level doesn't protect from non-repeatable read, so in the first transaction, the read queries will get different values. 
 That will result in updating bob's balance by +15.

Repeatable Read: 

It seems that this isolation level protects from non-repeatable read so in the first transaction the read queries will get the same values. 
Only accounts with group_id = 2 before the transactions began will have an updated balance.




Exercise 3:

It seems that the  T1 doesn't get affected by moving bob to group2 even In both isolation levels.
the reason is that both isolation levels prevent non-repeatable reads.

while in the last read query in T1 we won't find bob because the update comes from the transaction T2 but in T2 we will find bob.
